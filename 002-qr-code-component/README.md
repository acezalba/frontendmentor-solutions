## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For this challenge I applied Semantic HTML markup to the card. I used `article` for the main body, `header` for the QR card container, and `section` for the card body. I also took a shot at using CSS custom properties. There are some attributes that are similar from the [first Frontend Mentor I did](../../index.html) so I added them here as well.
